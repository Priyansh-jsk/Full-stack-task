# Full-stack-task

Description
You need to build an end-to-end application to display information extracted from different project description. The user should be able to see the information in the form of Gallery view or tiles and able to search specific projects.
1.	You are provided with a file containing the details extracted from a sample of 100 projects.
2.	Please load this information into a database and implement backend APIs to access this data on front-end.
3.	Build a user interface where all this information gets displayed in a gallery view (high-level UI sketches are provided in the user story below).
4.	Build a list view for the user where user can explore a given project in detail, looking at all the parameters.
5.	Build a search functionality where user can search projects.
a.	Optional: Smart search functionality with the help of GPT-3.5/4 where one can do multi-attribute search. For ex, find me projects where ReactJS is used in front-end, and Python is used in backend.
6.	Optional: You create a responsive app that works on different screen sizes including mobile also.

High-level Sketches
These sketches are indicative in nature. Please feel free to use your own creativity and skills for better UI designs.
1.	Displaying all the projects in a gallery view.
2.	Ability to click on any of the project and see the detailed information.
3.	Ability to search using a free-form query on the project information. For ex, find me projects which uses python in the backend. The user interface should show only filtered project list in the same view as #1.

Technologies
â€¢	You can use any front-end/backend/database technologies to build above application. The preference would be Next.js or React.JS for front-end, Node or Python for Backend
